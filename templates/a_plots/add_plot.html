                    <p><strong>Description: </strong>Add the details of what it is you like about the plot. Such as if
                        it is sunny or with shade. Is it close to the facilities, like the showers, electric hookup and water?</p>

                        is an excellent system to mark a spot easily. The whole
                        of the earth is divided into 3m squares. You could be in the middle of a desert or in forest,
                        well away from any civilisation. Still you can send an address using just 3 words.</p>
                    <p>Add the complete url including https://</p>
<h4 class="p-2 text-center text-white bg-danger">IMPORTANT</h4>
<p>Especially for the non campsite spots. If you don't add the What3Words address, no one else will be able to find it and you might not find it again either.</p>

                    <p><strong>Campsite: </strong>What is the name of the campsite</p>
                    <p><strong>Categories: </strong>What sort of camping? Three categories to choose from. Wild and that's where ever and without any 
                    organisation. The other options are Camping site and Official site but not a camp site. Here in Spain many towns set up a place for 
                passing campervans, RV, and Motorhomes. Be aware some countries don't allow wild camping if you want to put up a tent. Usually due to wild fire concerns, 
                which seems reasonable here in dry Spain. </p>
